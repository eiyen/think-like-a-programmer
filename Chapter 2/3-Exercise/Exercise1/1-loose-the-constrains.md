How to change the position of cursor in output?

I've search many solotions, but all of those used the spaces.

But constrains say that we can only use `cout << '#'` and `cout << '\n'` but not `cout << ' '`.

So I get stuck here.

P.S. The same to next exercises.

But I'll try loose the constrains and allow me to use the space.
